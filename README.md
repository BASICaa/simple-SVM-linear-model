# Simple SVM Linear Model

This repository contains scripts for training and displaying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) linear model using Python. The model is trained on a 2D dataset and visualizes the decision boundary.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `scipy`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```sh
pip install scipy numpy matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
